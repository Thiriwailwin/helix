FTP-Based Data Management System
Overview
The FTP-Based Data Management System is a robust, secure, and automated solution for managing the ingestion, processing, and storage of water quality sensor data from remote field locations to a central data repository. Designed for the Novara Water Quality Monitoring Project, this system bridges the gap between legacy IoT infrastructure and modern cloud-based analytics by providing a reliable, scheduled data pipeline.

Key Features
Automated FTP Data Ingestion: Scheduled, secure retrieval of CSV sensor data files from remote FTP servers.

Data Validation & Cleaning: Ensures data integrity through format verification, handling of missing values, and standardization.

Secure Centralized Storage: Loads processed and validated data into a structured PostgreSQL database.

Resilient Error Handling: Robust logging, failure notifications, and retry logic to ensure pipeline reliability.

Security-First Design: Implements secure credential management, input sanitization, and secure communication protocols.

Architecture & Workflow
The system follows a linear Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline:

Extract: A scheduled job securely connects to configured remote FTP servers using stored credentials and downloads new CSV data files generated by field sensors.

Transform: Each file is parsed and validated. Data is cleaned (handling NaN, correcting formats) and transformed into a structured format compatible with the central database schema.

Load: The transformed data is inserted into the PostgreSQL database, which serves as the single source of truth for all downstream applications, dashboards, and analyses.

Log & Monitor: Every step is logged. Successes, warnings, and failures are recorded for audit trails and system monitoring.
